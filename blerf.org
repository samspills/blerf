** DRAFT I blerfed it :nonsense:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: blerfed-it
:END:
What's up nerds[fn:1], I'm back. Trying to figure this whole situation out.
To figure out:
- [X] is this post getting generated?
- [X] how to make a footnote?
- [ ] What do these checkboxes look like?
- [ ] Did I figure out syntax highlighting?

#+begin_src scala
// this is just some sample code to check highlighting
def blerf(name: String): Unit = println(s"Hey, $name, did you know that Sam blerfed it?")
#+end_src
