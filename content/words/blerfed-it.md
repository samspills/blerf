What's up nerds[^fn:1], I'm back. Trying to figure this whole situation out.
To figure out:

-   [X] is this post getting generated?
-   [X] how to make a footnote?
-   [X] What do these checkboxes look like?
    -   they look totally reasonable
-   [ ] Did I figure out syntax highlighting?
    -   hot damn I did! Good job Past Sam!
-   [ ] different code styling?
-   [ ] line numbers??

I am looking at this on a small screen and it looks not great. I think I would like to experiment
with different themes that are better layouts on a small screen.

```scala
// this is just some sample code to check highlighting
def blerf(name: String): Unit = println(s"Hey, $name, did you know that Sam blerfed it?")
```

[^fn:1]: It's me. My past self is nerds.
